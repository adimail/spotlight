The Law Language Model (LLM) is a tool that democratizes access to legal information in India. It extracts, organizes, and stores text data from official Indian government legal documents and trains a specialized Large Language Model for Law. This LLM serves as the backbone of a user-friendly chatbot capable of comprehending legal queries and prompts in multiple Indian languages. Using advanced NLP and ML techniques, LLM can provide contextually relevant and accurate responses to legal inquiries. Additionally, it incorporates multilingual capabilities and utilizes Google Cloud Translation AI and Text-To-Speech (TTS) technology to bridge the information gap for marginalized communities and individuals with low literacy levels.
